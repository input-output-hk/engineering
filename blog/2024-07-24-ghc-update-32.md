## High-level Summary


## Details

Sylvain: fixed RTS linker on AArch64 to use the M32 allocator to avoid an excessive amount of calls to `mmap` and fragmentation. See [GHC#24432](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24432) and [GHC!12914](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12914). This was done in the process to update patches from haskell.nix to GHC upstream. This patch however is different from its haskell.nix counterpart which introduces a new allocator memory pool based allocator with different tradeoffs.
