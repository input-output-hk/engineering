Biweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## JavaScript backend

- Sylvain: fixed the implementation of some thread-related primops
(listThreads, getThreadLabel...).
See [GHC!10303](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10303)

- Sylvain: regenerated Cabal lexer with a newer Alex containing his bug fix
for the JS backend (cf previous update). Some Cabal tests had to be updated in the process because
they were relying on an Alex bug which has been fixed. This raised the question of
bug fixes vs the PVP. See [Cabal#8896](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/8896),
[Alex#227](https://github.com/haskell/alex/issues/227),
and [PVP#49](https://github.com/haskell/pvp/issues/49).


### Pipeline refactoring and new IR

### Faster weak references implementation?

### Testsuite and cleanup

- Sylvain: replaced uses of obsolescent `egrep` with `grep -E`. Otherwise
recent `egrep` programs print a warning that makes some GHC golden tests fail.
See [GHC#22351](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22351)
and [GHC!10308](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10308).

### Code generator and performance

## Miscellaneous
