Biweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## JavaScript backend

- Sylvain: fixed the implementation of some thread-related primops
(listThreads, getThreadLabel...).
See [GHC!10303](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10303)

- Sylvain: regenerated Cabal lexer with a newer Alex containing his bug fix
for the JS backend (cf previous update). Some Cabal tests had to be updated in the process because
they were relying on an Alex bug which has been fixed. This raised the question of
bug fixes vs the PVP. See [Cabal#8896](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/8896),
[Alex#227](https://github.com/haskell/alex/issues/227),
and [PVP#49](https://github.com/haskell/pvp/issues/49).

- Josh: added an implementation for `mkdir` for node targets. Primarily this is
expected to be used by Cabal setup scripts, but any JS backend programs running on
node will be able to use it. See [GHC!10279](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10279).

- Josh: fixed the `-fcheck-prim-bounds` flag for the JS backend. The old implementation
mostly only caused false negatives in the bounds that were rejected (i.e. it would miss
some invalid bounds), but it some cases there were also false positives, caused by
casted byte array indexing operations being indexed on the casted type's size.
See [GHC!10234](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10234).

- Josh: fixed the JS implementation for the `access` function on files. This
function comes from C, but node also provides a direct equivalent - which the new
implementation uses. See [GHC!10301](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10301).

- Luite: Worked on optimizing finalizers by disabling heap scanning and found
an issue affecting `debugIO` in the base library. This is caused by the code
generated for `h$appendToHsStringA`. A fix is now ready, see
[GHC!10312](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10312)

### Pipeline refactoring and new IR

- Jeff: [MR!10260](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10260)
ready to land. This MR paves the way for the new IR, changes the small
optimization pass the JavaScript backend had to target the current IR instead of
directly printing optimized forms, and adds an IR to IR optimizer. CI shows that
the compile time allocations for the JavaScript backend is reduced an average of
3.3% with a maximum reduction 13% with this MR. Note that these reductions
come from cleaner code generation, not from the optimizer.

### Testsuite and cleanup

- Sylvain: replaced uses of obsolescent `egrep` with `grep -E`. Otherwise
recent `egrep` programs print a warning that makes some GHC golden tests fail.
See [GHC#22351](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22351)
and [GHC!10308](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10308).

### Documentation

- Luite: Finished the blog post on the lightweight stacks and calling convention
the JavaScript backend uses. This will be published on the IOG engineering blog
shortly.


## GHC Proposal #0134 (Deprecated Exports)

- Bartek: Implemented the parsing and pretty printing of warnings of deprecated exports.
See [GHC!10283](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10283) for the partial
implementation of the proposal so far.

## Performance

- Jeff : First case study on performance engineering for the [Haskell
Optimization Handbook](https://input-output-hk.github.io/hs-opt-handbook.github.io/) is almost done. The case study demonstrates a first pass
of performance engineering on the klister programming language's interpreter.
The chapter demonstrates the use of ticky ticky, info-table, biography and
retainer analysis profiling to gain a 6-fold improvement in the interpreter.

- Josh: Updated the unboxed codebuffers implementation to include pattern
synonyms for backwards-compatability. Now, the implementation of handle encoding
in base can be updated to be more performant without requiring external changes.
See [GHC!9948](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9948).
