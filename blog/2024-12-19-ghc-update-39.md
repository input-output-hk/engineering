## High-level Summary

The team has been working on the preparation of a GHC 9.6.7 release and on
building GHC with cabal-install instead of Hadrian.

## Details

Luite: Is back from vacation and has been preparing the GHC 9.6.7 release. See (GHC#25559[https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25559] and (GHC!13740)[https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13740].

Sylvain: worked on building GHC with cabal-install instead of Hadrian. During the process he noticed that the Cabal flags for the RTS were wrongly set on automatic. This is now fixed by [GHC!13697](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13697).

Sylvain: fixed the build of GHC with tables-next-to-code disabled. See [GHC#25565](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25565) and [GHC!13712](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13712)

Sylvain: merged `ghc-bignum` package into `ghc-internal`. See [GHC#24453](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24453) and [GHC!13688](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13688)
