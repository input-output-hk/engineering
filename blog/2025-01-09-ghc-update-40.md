## High-level Summary

We wish you a happy and productive 2025 year!

A small update this time due to the end of year vacations. Work on
releasing GHC 9.6.7 and on building GHC with Cabal has been resumed.

Sadly for us our teammate Jeff has decided to leave the team. We wish him all
the best in his future endeavours! We are thankful for everything he has done
with us. On the bright side, there should be an open position in our team soon,
so stay tuned.
