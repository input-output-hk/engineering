Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## High-level Summmary

The team attended the Haskell Foundation Workshop, Zurihac, and an IOG meetup in ZÃ¼rich.
Many interesting discussions and some [in-person bug
fixing](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/9571#issuecomment-2162608644).
We also noticed that there is still quite a lot of interest in our previous work
on the JavaScript backend.

## Details

Luite: continued work on per-thread control of profiling counters for cost
centre stack profiling. Discussions with the db-sync team identified the need
for counters while in FFI calls (e.g. PostgreSQL queries) which we will work on.

Sylvain: compiler performance: use `IntSet` backed data structure instead of
`UniqSet Unique` (which duplicates the `Unique` which is used as key and value).
[GHC#23605](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23605)
[GHC!12687](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12687).

Jeff: factorized uses of ad-hoc FastStrings (interned strings) in the JS backend
to prepare for potential future improvements (type-safe eDSL, better codegen...).
[GHC!12698](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12698)

Sylvain: fixed parsing of HexFloatLiterals syntax for unboxed literals
[GHC#22155](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22155)
[GHC!12657](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12657).

Most of the rest is work-in-progress and will be reported when completed.
