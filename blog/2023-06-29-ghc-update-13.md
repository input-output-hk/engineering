Biweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## JavaScript backend

- Luite: implemented JS support for running interactive processes via the `process` library by using NodeJS features. See [Process#292](https://github.com/haskell/process/pull/292). This change fixes a major issue with Cabal's custom `Setup.hs` scripts which are built with the JS backend (i.e. when not using haskell.nix) as these scripts need to run other processes such as `ghc` interactively.

- Sylvain: fixed an issue with exception pretty-printing. [GHC#23565](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23565) and [GHC!10739](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10739).

- Sylvain: fixed an issue with levity polymorphic data constructors. [GHC#22360](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22360) and [GHC!10681](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10681). It also fixed [GHC#22291](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22291) as a side-effect.

- Sylvain: disabled dumping the `eventlog` into `stderr` by default [GHC!10677](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10677). We still neeed a better eventlog implementation but at least it fixed the `T16707` test in the `stm` package that was failing fo a reason unrelated to stm.

## GHCi

- Luite: added support for large stack offsets in the ByteCode to fix [GHC#22888](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22888). See [GHC!9957](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9957).

## Miscellaneous

- Sylvain: implemented a `-prelude-is` GHC flag to make the `Prelude` module selectable, following the discussion on [Discourse](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/a-modern-take-on-the-prelude/6619). See ticket [GHC#23551](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23551) and merge request [GHC!10704](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10704). Not sure if/when it's going to be merged. Do show your support on the issue if you want this.
