Biweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## JavaScript backend

- Sylvain:

- Luite: implemented JS support for running interactive processes via the `process` library by using NodeJS features. See [Process#292](https://github.com/haskell/process/pull/292). This change fixes a major issue with Cabal's custom `Setup.hs` scripts which are built with the JS backend (i.e. when not using haskell.nix) as these scripts need to run other processes such as `ghc` interactively.

- Josh:

- Jeff:
 
## Deprecation warnings

- Bartek:

## Incomplete Record Selectors

- Bartek:

## GHCi

- Luite: added support for large stack offsets in the ByteCode to fix [GHC#22888](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22888). See [GHC!9957](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9957).

## Miscellaneous

- Sylvain: implemented a `-prelude-is` GHC flag to make the `Prelude` module selectable, following the discussion on [Discourse](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/a-modern-take-on-the-prelude/6619). See ticket [GHC#23551](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23551) and merge request [GHC!10704](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10704). Not sure if/when it's going to be merged. Do show your support on the issue if you want this.
