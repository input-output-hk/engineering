Biweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

## JavaScript backend

Sylvain: fixed build of GHC with the `quickest` Hadrian flavour.
It was failing due to a incorrect coercion in `ghc-heap`.
See [#23181](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23181)
and [!10192](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10192)

Jeff: Began to implement the plan to add GHCJS's optimizer to the JavaScript
backend. This item is slated for GHC 9.8 and is on our
[roadmap](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/javascript-backend). The
[first step](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10142), which
is now finished, is to split the intermediate representation the backend uses to
isolate all code generation. This split then allows us to change the existing
intermediate representation for the RTS and GC, remove some cruft that was
adopted from GHCJS, and add optimization passes.

Jeff: Tested generating `let` instead of `var` to take advantage of more recent
JavaScript standards than GHCJS comported to. However, this change produced such
significant runtime regressions in the generated JavaScript that we abandoned it. 

Sylvain: fixed an out-of-bound array access in code generated by Alex, the lexer
generator, see [Alex#223](https://github.com/haskell/alex/pull/223). The out-of-bound access
only triggers an exception with the JS backend; with native backends it only causes a
benign data corruption. This was found in Cabal-syntax's lexer, which still needs to be
regenerated, see [Cabal#8892](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/8892).

Josh: brought the callbacks CLC ticket to vote. Now it has enough votes to be
passed, so we're just awaiting a formal conclusion. Following this, the JavaScript
backend will be able to pass Haskell functions to foreign imports as JavaScript
callbacks, which in turn enables JavaScript to call into Haskell code.

Merge request: [GHC MR 10128](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10128)

Josh: debugged an issue with the `-fcheck-prim-bounds` flag. The errors were mostly
false negatives in the indicies that were rejected, but there were also a false positive
due to the existing code not accounting for zero-size ranges being allowed in range-based
operations (even at indicies that don't exist, such as negative).

Merge request: [GHC MR 10234](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10234)

Luite: Worked on using the JavaScript finalization functionality for Haskell weak references.
It looks like it's not possible to keep the existing "GHC style" reachability semantics from
`System.Mem.Weak`. Our new approach is to create a "JavaScript style" variant in `System.Mem.Weak.JS`
that avoids the need for expensive heap scanning. Both variants of weak references
can be supported by the JavaScript backend, and heap scanning can be avoided if there
are no pending finalizers for "GHC style" weak references (in progress).

## Compiler Performance

Jeff: Finally landed
[MR!9702](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9702) which
refactored GHC's driver to use more eficient data structures. This refactor
reduced allocations _for every_ test in GHC's testsuite, with an geometric mean
of -1.6%.

## Team

The DevX team at IOG welcomes our summer intern Bartek! Bartek will be working
on GHC proposal
[134](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0134-deprecating-exports-proposal.rst#implementation-plan);
deprecating exports,
[516](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0516-incomplete-record-selectors.rst);
adding warnings for incomplete record selectors, and [deprecating
instances](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/575). We are glad
to be working with him and happy to have him on the team.

## GHC migration and stability

Bartek: Started this sprint and has begun to read through the front end code of
GHC to begin working on one of the ghc proposal tickets next week.

## Miscellaneous

Sylvain: Fixed linker warning issue with `-fproc-alignment=64`. See
[#20758](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/20758) and [!10200](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10200).
