One of the key challenges in any novel backend is representing GHC primitive
types in the new backend. For JavaScript, this is especially tricky, as
JavaScript only has 8 primitive types and some of those types, such as `number` do
not directly map to any Haskell primitive type, such as `Int8#`. This post walks
through the most important GHC primitives and describes our implementation for
each in the JavaScript backend. This post is intended to be an
explanation-oriented post, light on details, but just enough to understand how
the system works.

# GHC Primitives

There are 36 `primtype`s that GHC defines in `primops.txt.pp`:

1.  `Char#`
2.  `Int8#`, `Int16#`, `Int32#`, `Int64#`, `Int#`
3.  `Word8#`, `Word16#`, `Word32#`, `Word64#`, `Word#`
4.  `Double#`, `Float#`,
5.  `Array#`, `MutableArray#`,, `SmallArray#`, `SmallMutableArray#`
6.  `ByteArray#`, `MutableByteArray#`
7.  `Addr#`
8.  `MutVar#`, `TVar#`, `MVar#`,
9.  `IOPort#`, `State#`, `RealWorld`, `ThreadId#`
10. `Weak#`, `StablePtr#`, `StableName#`, `Compact#`, `BCO`,
11. `Fun`, `Proxy#`
12. `StackSnapshot#`
13. `VECTOR`

Some of these are unsupported in the JS-backend, such as `VECTOR` or lower
priority such as `StackSnapshot#`. We&rsquo;ll begin with the easy cases.


<a id="org75a0c27"></a>

## The Easy Cases

The easy cases are the cases that are implemented as JavaScript objects. In
general, this is the big hammer used when nothing else will do. We&rsquo;ll expand on
the use of objects&#x2014;especially representing heap objects&#x2014;in a future post,
but for the majority of cases we mimic the STG-machine behavior for GHC heap
objects using JavaScript heap objects. For example,

    var someConstructor =
        { f  =                   // entry function of the datacon worker
        , m  = 0                 // garbage collector mark
        , d1 = first arg         // First data field for the constructor
        , d2 = arity = 2: second arg // second field, or object containing the remaining fields
               arity > 2: { d1, d2, ...} object with remaining args (starts with "d1 = x2"!)
        }

This is the general recipe; we define a JavaScript object that contains
properties which correspond to the entry function of the heap object; in this
case that is the entry function, `f` for a constructor, some meta data for garbage
collection `m`, and pointers to the fields of the constructor or whatever else the
heap object might need. Using JavaScript objects allows straightforward
translations of several GHC types. For example `TVar`s and `MVar`s:

    // stg.js.pp
    /** @constructor */
    function h$TVar(v) {
        TRACE_STM("creating TVar, value: " + h$collectProps(v));
        this.val        = v;           // current value
        this.blocked    = new h$Set(); // threads that get woken up if this TVar is updated
        this.invariants = null;        // invariants that use this TVar (h$Set)
        this.m          = 0;           // gc mark
        this._key       = ++h$TVarN;   // for storing in h$Map/h$Set
    #ifdef GHCJS_DEBUG_ALLOC
        h$debugAlloc_notifyAlloc(this);
    #endif
    }

    // stm.js.pp
    function h$MVar() {
      TRACE_SCHEDULER("h$MVar constructor");
      this.val     = null;
      this.readers = new h$Queue();
      this.writers = new h$Queue();
      this.waiters = null;  // waiting for a value in the MVar with ReadMVar
      this.m       = 0; // gc mark
      this.id      = ++h$mvarId;
    #ifdef GHCJS_DEBUG_ALLOC
      h$debugAlloc_notifyAlloc(this);
    #endif
    }

Notice that both implementations defined properties specific to the semantics of
the Haskell type. JavaScript functions which create these objects follow the
naming convention `h$<something>` and reside in *Shim* files. *Shim* files are
JavaScript files that the JS-backend links against and are written in pure
JavaScript. This allows us to save some compile time by not generating code
which doesn&rsquo;t change, and decompose the backend into JavaScript modules.

This strategy is also how functions are implemented in the JS-backend. Function
objects are generated by `StgToJS.Expr.genExpr` and `StgToJS.Apply.genApp` but
follow this recipe:

    var myFUN =
     { f  = <function itself>
     , m  = <garbage collector mark>
     , d1 = free variable 1
     , d2 = free variable 2
     }

To summarize; for most cases we write custom JavaScript objects which hold
whatever machinery is needed as properties to satisfy the expected semantics of
the Haskell type. This is the strategy that implements: `TVar`, `MVar`, `MutVar` and
`Fun`.

## ByteArray#, MutableByteArray#, SmallArray#, MutableSmallArray#,

For some types, such as `ByteArray#` we make engineering tradeoffs to optimize for
common use-cases. Consider the `mem.js.pp` shim, which defines `ByteArray#`:

    // mem.js.pp
    function h$newByteArray(len) {
      var len0 = Math.max(h$roundUpToMultipleOf(len, 8), 8);
      var buf = new ArrayBuffer(len0);
      return { buf: buf
             , len: len
             , i3: new Int32Array(buf)
             , u8: new Uint8Array(buf)
             , u1: new Uint16Array(buf)
             , f3: new Float32Array(buf)
             , f6: new Float64Array(buf)
             , dv: new DataView(buf)
             , m: 0
             }
    }

`ByteArray#` follows the same recipe, `buf` is the payload of the `ByteArray#`,
`len` is the length of the `ByteArray#`. This is implemented using JavaScripts
`ArrayBuffer` object to yield a generic fixed-length raw binary data buffer. The
remaining properties are *views* over the payload to provide fast conversion at
the cost of extra memory allocation during object construction.

## Addr# and StablePtr#

`Addr#` and `StablePtr#` are defined as a typed array or object holding a typed
array and some offset into that array. We&rsquo;ll focus on `Addr#` because
`StablePtr#` is the same implementation, with the exception that the
`StablePtr#` is tracked in the global variable `h$stablePtrBuf`. `Addr#` are
constructed in `h$rts_mkPtr`:

    function h$rts_mkPtr(x) {
      var buf, off = 0;
      if(typeof x == 'string') {
    
        buf = h$encodeUtf8(x);
        off = 0;
      } else if(typeof x == 'object' &&
         typeof x.len == 'number' &&
         x.buf instanceof ArrayBuffer) {
    
        buf = x;
        off = 0;
      } else if(x.isView) {
    
        buf = h$wrapBuffer(x.buffer, true, 0, x.buffer.byteLength);
        off = x.byteOffset;
      } else {
    
        buf = h$wrapBuffer(x, true, 0, x.byteLength);
        off = 0;
      }
      return (h$c2(h$baseZCGHCziPtrziPtr_con_e, (buf), (off)));
    }

The function does some type inspection to check for the special case on
`string`, if we do not have a string then an `Addr#` is returned by creating a
new `ArrayBuffer` and an offset into that buffer. The `object` case checks for
idempotency; if the input is already an `Addr#`, then just return the input. The
interesting cases are the cases which call to `h$wrapBuffer`:

    // mem.js.pp
    function h$wrapBuffer(buf, unalignedOk, offset, length) {
      if(!unalignedOk && offset && offset % 8 !== 0) {
        throw ("h$wrapBuffer: offset not aligned:" + offset);
      }
      if(!buf || !(buf instanceof ArrayBuffer))
        throw "h$wrapBuffer: not an ArrayBuffer"
      if(!offset) { offset = 0; }
      if(!length || length < 0) { length = buf.byteLength - offset; }
      return { buf: buf
             , len: length
             , i3: (offset%4) ? null : new Int32Array(buf, offset, length >> 2)
             , u8: new Uint8Array(buf, offset, length)
             , u1: (offset%2) ? null : new Uint16Array(buf, offset, length >> 1)
             , f3: (offset%4) ? null : new Float32Array(buf, offset, length >> 2)
             , f6: (offset%8) ? null : new Float64Array(buf, offset, length >> 3)
             , dv: new DataView(buf, offset, length)
             };
    }

`h$wrapBuffer` is a utility function that does the allocation for the typed array,
and stores extra fields to coerce the data in the `buf` payload efficiently.

## Numbers: The Involved Case

Translating numbers has two issues. First, JavaScript has no concept of
fixed-precision 64-bit types such as `Int64#` and `Word64#`. Second, numbers are
atomic types and do not require any special properties for correct semantics,
thus using wrapping objects gains us nothing at the cost of indirection.


<a id="orgc9d245e"></a>

### Working with 64-bit Types

To expressing 64-bit numerics, we simply use two 32-bit numbers, one to express
the high bits, one for the low bits. For example, consider comparing two `Int64#:`

    // arith.js.pp
    function h$hs_ltInt64(h1,l1,h2,l2) {
      if(h1 === h2) {
        var l1s = l1 >>> 1;
        var l2s = l2 >>> 1;
        return (l1s < l2s || (l1s === l2s && ((l1&1) < (l2&1)))) ? 1 : 0;
      } else {
        return (h1 < h2) ? 1 : 0;
      }
    }

The less than comparison function expects four inputs, two for each `Int64#` in
Haskell. The first number is represented by `h1` and `l1` (*high* and *low*),
and similarly the second number is represented by `h2` and `l2`. The comparison
is straightforward, we check equivalence of our high bits, if equal then we
check the lower bits while being careful with signedness. No surprises here.

### Unwrapped Number Optimization

I mentioned earlier that wrapper objects are inefficient for numerics. To
implement efficent numerics we use an optimization that detects if an object is
going to be a `number`, if so then we remove the wrapper object and return just
the payload, i.e., the number itself. 

Fixed-precision Integer types are implemented in the `rts.js.pp` shim, for
example:

    function h$rts_mkInt8(x) { return (x<<24)>>24; }
    function h$rts_getInt8(x) { return ((typeof(x) === 'number')?(x):(x).d1); }

Notice that the `getInt8` function calls the `typeof` operator to check the type
of the input object. In JavaScript, we can think of this as a form of [pointer
tagging](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/commentary/rts/haskell-execution/pointer-tagging)
the native code generator uses. `typeof` scrutinizes the input and checks if it
is actually `number`. If it is a number then it is `UnBoxed`, if it is an object
then it is `Boxed`, and is a heap object. The difference is between the type
`Int8`, which is `Boxed` (a pointer to the heap, and lifted; can contain &perp;)
and `Int8#` which is `UnBoxed` and is not a pointer but actually the value.

In general, in the JS-backend we deal with `Boxed` values that are heap objects.
But numbers are different. Consider the case where we want to add two `Int8`
(both are boxed) in the JS backend. We really only care whether both `Int8`s are
`Thunk`s or not, if they are thunks then we have to inspect them on the heap,
and call their entry functions which eventually returns their values; but this
process is expensive! If they are not `Thunk`s, then we do not need to treat
them like heap objects and can represent the `Int8` directly as an `Int8#`
(`UnBoxed`). Thus an `Int8#` is always a JavaScript number, never a JS object,
but an `Int8` can be either a JS number or an object depending on the code
involved and whether it was subject to this optimization.

The optimization is applicable when:

1.  We have a single data type with a single data constructor.
2.  The constructor holds a single field that *can only* be a particular type.

If these invariants hold then, we remove the wrapping object and instead refer
to the value held by the constructor directly. `Int8` is the simplest case for
this optimization. In Haskell we have:

    data Int8 = Int8 Int8#

Notice that this definition satisfies the requirements. A direct translation in
the JS backend would be:

    // Int8 represented as an Object with an entry function, f, and payload, d1.
    var anInt8 = { d1 = <Int8# payload>
                 , f  : entry function which would scrutinize the payload
                 }

But we can operationally distinguish between a `Thunk` and an `Int8` because
these will have separate types in the `StgToJS` GHC pass, whereas in Haskell an
`Int8` may actually be a `Thunk` until it is scrutinized *and then* becomes the
`Int8` payload (i.e., call-by-need). So this means that we will always know when
we have an `Int8` rather than a `Thunk` and therefore we can omit the wrapper
object and convert this code to just:

    // no object, just payload
    var anInt8 = = <Int8# payload>

For the interested reader, this optimization takes place in the JavaScript code
generator module `GHC.StgToJS.Arg`, specifically the functions `allocConStatic`,
`isUnboxableCon`, and `primRepVt`.

## But what about the other stuff!

-   `Char#`: has no representation in JavaScript
-   `Addr#` a pair of an array created by `h$newByteArray` and an offset that indexes
-   `Float#/Double#`: Both represented as a JavaScript Double.
