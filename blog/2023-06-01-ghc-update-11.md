Biweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## JavaScript backend

- Sylvain: updated the MR implementing Template Haskell for the JS backend
  [!9779](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9779) to start
  fixing the remaining recompilation avoidance issues.

- Sylvain: prepared slides for the GHC workshop about the JS backend. See you
  there next week!

- Luite: Continued working on support for the `process` package with the JS backend,
  moving JavaScript specific functionality into the `System.Process.JavaScript` module.
  Most functionality works, but sometimes tests hang, which seems to be caused by
  nodejs being inconsistent emitting events on child process creation.

## Deprecation warnings

- Bartek: Deprecated exports proposal MR passes CI and has all the issues addressed, waiting for the MR to be accepted
See [GHC!10283](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10283)

- Bartek: Slight rework of parsing and storing the custom warnings so that it's more generalized (for the upcoming Deprecated Instances)
See [GHC!10531](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10531)

- Bartek: Parsing for the Deprecated Instances implemented, still waiting for the [proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/575) to be accepted

## Performance

## Miscelleaneous
- Jeff: The FUNARCH version of the [GHC Modularity](https://hsyl20.fr/home/files/papers/2022-ghc-modularity.pdf) paper is submitted!
