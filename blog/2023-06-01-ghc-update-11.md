## JavaScript backend

- Sylvain: updated the MR implementing Template Haskell for the JS backend
  [!9779](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9779) to start
  fixing the remaining recompilation avoidance issues.

- Sylvain: prepared slides for the GHC workshop about the JS backend. See you
  there next week!

- Luite: Continued working on support for the `process` package with the JS backend,
  moving JavaScript specific functionality into the `System.Process.JavaScript` module.
  Most functionality works, but sometimes tests hang, which seems to be caused by
  nodejs being inconsistent emitting events on child process creation.
  
- Josh: merged changes to the JavaScript code rendering. Previously, we used GHC's `SDoc`
  system, which included a hack of using the `layLeft` function to remove indentation
  from rendered code to improve code size. Now, code is instead rendered on one
  line using GHC's new `HLine` system. `HLine` doesn't have to waste time on indentation
  logic, and instead simply concatenates very quickly. It also renders directly to a file
  handle, rather than spending memory on an intermediate `ByteString`.
  
  Additionally, the flag `-ddisable-js-minifier` is added in this MR, which causes JS
  code to be rendered with full human-readable indentation and whitespace.
  
  See: [GHC!10500](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10500)
  
- Josh: fixed an issue where `ghc --supported-extensions` was incorrectly listing
  `JavaScriptFFI`. This issue had a workaround in Cabal for several years, but the workaround
  was causing issues for Cabal support in the JavaScript backend. Now, the extension is removed
  from non-JavaScript targets, allowing the Cabal workaround to be reverted for new versions
  of GHC.

## Deprecation warnings

- Bartek: Deprecated exports proposal MR passes CI and has all the issues addressed, waiting for the MR to be accepted
See [GHC!10283](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10283)

- Bartek: Slight rework of parsing and storing the custom warnings so that it's more generalized (for the upcoming Deprecated Instances)
See [GHC!10531](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10531)

- Bartek: Parsing for the Deprecated Instances implemented, still waiting for the [proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/575) to be accepted

## Miscelleaneous
- Jeff: The FUNARCH version of the [GHC Modularity](https://hsyl20.fr/home/files/papers/2022-ghc-modularity.pdf) paper is submitted!
