Sylvain: helped debugging
[iserv-proxy-interpreter](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/iserv-proxy) which was
failing with `internal error:Evaluated a CAF that was GC'd!`. It turned out that
this interpreter didn't disable CAF garbage collection contrary to
[GHC](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/compiler/cbits/keepCAFsForGHCi.c)
and the non-proxy [external
interpreter](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/utils/iserv/cbits/iservmain.c).
