Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## JS backend

Luite: Fixed some bugs in the new JStg intermediate representation. `newIdents` was broken, which resulted in the same identifiers
being generated multiple times (see [GHC!11569](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11569). Some local variable declarations
were missing, causing global variables to be used instead (or programs to fail with an error in strict mode). See
[GHC!11581](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11581).

Luite: Continued work on the JStg optimizer. Floating of single-use values into expressions (removing an intermediate assignment) and constant
folding with integers and booleans in expressions now work. See [GHC!11507](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11507)
for work in progress.

Josh: Fixed several bugs remaining in `ghcjs-base` that occur with the JavaScript backend.

Josh: Finished updating `ghcjs-base`, `ghcjs-dom`, `jsaddle`, and `jsaddle-dom` to work with the JavaScript backend on GHC 9.8.1. These will
be officially released soon, for now see:
* `ghcjs-base`: https://github.com/JoshMeredith/ghcjs-base/tree/wip/js-backend
* `ghcjs-dom`: https://github.com/JoshMeredith/ghcjs-dom/tree/wip/js-backend
* `jsaddle`: https://github.com/JoshMeredith/jsaddle/tree/wip/js-backend
* `jsaddle-dom`: https://github.com/JoshMeredith/jsaddle-dom/tree/wip/js-backend

Sylvain: fixed support for "wrapper" and "dynamic" FFI imports. This is part of the work towards linking C sources with JS sources
using Emscripten. This issue came while compiling `sqlite.c`. [GHC!11525](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11525)

## Misc

Sylvain: helped debugging
[iserv-proxy-interpreter](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/iserv-proxy) which was
failing with `internal error:Evaluated a CAF that was GC'd!` (see [iserv-proxy!1](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/iserv-proxy/-/merge_requests/1)).
It turned out that this interpreter didn't disable CAF garbage collection contrary to
[GHC](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/compiler/cbits/keepCAFsForGHCi.c)
and the non-proxy [external
interpreter](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/utils/iserv/cbits/iservmain.c).

Sylvain: fixed a compiler panic triggered by some package database state with
unusable packages
[GHC!11604](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11604).
This has been reported quite a few times on the GHC tracker [GHC#21097](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/21097),
[GHC#11050](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/11050), [GHC#16996](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/16996),
and internally on IOG channels. Before that a workaround was to delete cabal-install's store (`~/.cabal/store` on Linux).

Jeff: Has been helping the Cardano team migrate to GHC-9.6.
