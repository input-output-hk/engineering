Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## High-level Summmary

Sprint focused on general maintenance of GHC (reviews, issue triage, etc.) and progress on opened merge requests.
Next sprint will be longer due to the team attending the Haskell Foundation Workshop, Zurihac, and IOG meetup. We hope to meet you at Zurihac!

## Details

Jeff: Finished lowering bitcast primops into the native code generators and the wasm backend. [GHC!12333](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12233) GHC now generates slightly smarter assembly in these cases.

### Minor stuff

Sylvain: fixed support for the `HexFloatLiterals` extension with unboxed literals. [GHC#22155](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22155) [GHC!12657](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12657)

Sylvain: fixed a call to `stgCallocBytes` triggering a new warning with recent GCCs. [GHC#24828](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24828) [GHC!12655](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12655)

Sylvain: reduced allocations in JS code generator due to a mistake. [GHC#24746](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24746) [GHC!12631](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12631)

Luite: Worked on a build issue related to libffi [GHC#24864](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24864)

Luite: Worked on per-thread control of profiling counters for cost centre stack profiling. This may add a new STG register similar to this proof of concept [luite/ghc/prof-status-register](https://gitlab.haskell.org/luite/ghc/-/tree/prof-status-register?ref_type=heads)
