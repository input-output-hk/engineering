Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## CI / Testsuite

- Sylvain: implemented `openat` in JavaScript. See
  [GHC#23697](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23697) and
  [GHC!10909](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10909).
  Found while working on `unix`'s package testsuite (see
  [Unix!285](https://github.com/haskell/unix/pull/285).

## Performance

- Josh: investigated alternative implementations of the union function for GHC's
  UDFM type, with the intent of removing the use of `Data.List.sort`. For unknown
  reasons, there were mixed results in GHC's performance tests.

- Josh: investigated the performance of package database loading in GHC. In comparing
  ticky profiles of simple builds with and without package databases (see https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/4093),
  there was a large amount of excess entries into `Word64Map.insert` and `List.++`.
  More investigation is required to find the source of these entries.

## JS Backend

- Josh: Built the GHCJS libraries against the first GHC 9.8 alpha release. There
  are many version bumps required in `ghcjs-base` dependencies, due to boot library
  changes, but not many code changes. Because of various JS backend fixes in GHC
  9.8, these library updates will delay the release of the GHCJS libraries for the
  JS backend.
