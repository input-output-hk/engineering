## High-level Summary


## Details

Sylvain: `ghc-up` [failed to build](https://github.com/haskus/packages/issues/62) with the latest release of my `haskus-utils-variant` package because I forgot to make a new release of one of its dependencies (`haskus-utils-data`). Managing several packages like this is a pain so I've released a new [`variant` package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/variant) which has minimal dependencies. I've implemented compatibility and added CI for GHC releases from 8.10 to 9.10 so it has become a much more reliable package to depend on.
