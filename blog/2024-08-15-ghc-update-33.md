Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## High-level Summary

The team is continuing the work on characterizing and upstreaming some GHC patches that are
only present in haskell.nix-provided GHCs.

## Details

Sylvain: fixed CI of his [haskus-utils-variant](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskus-utils-variant) package that is used by [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) and that was causing [build failure in nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/212716#issuecomment-2290942272). In the process I've fixed an issue in doctests about error links produced by GHC 9.10 [doctest#448](https://github.com/sol/doctest/pull/448).
