Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## High-level Summary

The team is continuing the work on characterizing and upstreaming some GHC patches that are
only present in haskell.nix-provided GHCs.

## Details

Sylvain: fixed CI of his [haskus-utils-variant](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskus-utils-variant) package that is used by [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) and that was causing [build failure in nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/212716#issuecomment-2290942272). In the process I've fixed an issue in doctests about error links produced by GHC 9.10 [doctest#448](https://github.com/sol/doctest/pull/448).

Sylvain: encountered and fixed an issue where GHC would pick the wrong `ghcversion.h` file which defines CPP constants such as `__GLASGOW_HASKELL__` (GHC version used). As a result some CPP conditionals were incorrectly evaluated for the GHC version used and some packages failed to build. [cabal#10229](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/10229) [GHC#25106](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25106) [GHC!13070](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13070)

Sylvain: fixed documentation in GHC's users guide about JS callbacks. [GHC#24377](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24377) [GHC!13119](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13119)

Sylvain: removed hack used in GHC's rts to support old versions of Cabal. The hack consisted in always linking with a compiled `.c` file in order to force cabal to create a library otherwise only composed of `.js` files. The hack is no longer needed since GHC used a more recent Cabal now. [GHC#25138](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25138) [GHC!13106](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13106)

Luite: Worked on improving locking for the GHC external interpreter (`iserv` and `ghc-interp.js`) to fix problems with `-j` [GHC#25083](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25083)

Luite: Looking into making the Windows toolchain choices more flexible, allowing `gcc` and `msvcrt` instead of just `clang`/`ucrt`.

Sylvain: fixed a bug with 64-bit literals compiled with a 32-bit compiler that were truncated. The current fix is only temporary as it disables some optimizations for 64-bit literals when compiled with a 32-bit compiler. A proper fix is still in the making and will be much more invasive and difficult to backport. [GHC#24893](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24893) [GHC!13096](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13096). The ticket tracking the proper fix is [GHC#25151](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25151)

Sylvain: adapted a patch from haskell.nix to support `AARCH64_R_NONE` relocations in the RTS linker [GHC!13113](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13113)

Sylvain: wrote about [GHC's stability](https://hsyl20.fr/posts/2024-08-07-about-ghcs-stability.html) and [support mutable fields in data constructors](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25105#note_579482)

Sylvain: done some refactoring of the linker code [GHC!13136](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13136) and [GHC!13142](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13142)
