Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## Performance

Sylvain: started adding support for branchless code generation in GHC's x86-64 native code generator
for STG case-expressions with two cheap and ok-for-speculation alternatives. See [GHC!11315](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11315).
This is promising as [previous work](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9654#note_471280) by Andreas showed that a ~10% performance
improvement was possible with an explicit conditional assignment primop and in our case the transformation would be automatic and would benefit even more programs.
Sadly for now there is still a subtle code generation issue: a GHC using the optimization to build test programs pass the testsuite, but a GHC itself built
with the optimization fails in some cases.

## Stability

Josh: worked on a proof of concept for a GHC flag that can mark language features as experimental, with the goal to have an enforcable separation between
features that can change between releases, and those that are committed to longer deprecation cycles for breaking changes.
See [GHC Steering Committee thread](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-steering-committee/2023-October/003489.html)

## Maintenance

Sylvain: fixed Stack support for the upcoming GHC 9.8.1.
[hi-file-parser#16](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/hi-file-parser/issues/16)
and
[hi-file-parser#17](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/hi-file-parser/pull/17)

## JS backend

Sylvain: started investigating on how to add support for foreign libraries compiled with Emscripten (e.g. C libraries like sqlite) to the JS backend. Nothing to share yet though.

Josh: wrote documentation in the GHC users guide for getting started writing `jsbits` - JavaScript files that supply functionality through the FFI. Typically, these replace
C functions that are often used in Haskell for system calls, but are also used for performance reasons.

See: [GHC!11291](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11291)

Josh: added implementations for the C functions `realpath`, `rename`, and `getcwd`. These are used in building `ghcjs-dom`, and also in some `Setup.hs` Cabal setup scripts. This
patch was backported to 9.8, so it will be in the upcoming release.

See: 
[GHC#23806](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23806)
[GHC!11062](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11062)

Luite: implemented support for `runInteractiveProcess` with the JavaScript backend. This allows Cabal's `Setup` program to work properly (cabal-install compiles `Setup.hs` with the cross-compiler, hence the JS backend has to support them until Cabal is fixed to support two toolchains for host and target). See [process#292](https://github.com/haskell/process/pull/292). This has been done a few weeks ago but was left out of previous reports.
