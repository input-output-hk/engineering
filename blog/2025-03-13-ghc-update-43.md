Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

<!-- truncate -->

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

Sylvain: completed the work to make a GHC built with cabal-install pass the
testsuite. See https://github.com/stable-haskell/ghc/pull/3 There is some more
work to be done to build a complete binary distribution: building several RTS
ways, etc.

Sylvain: fixed the merge of `flags` stanzas in `cabal.project` files. See [Cabal#10767](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/10767) and [Cabal!10805](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/10805).

Luite: Tested and prepared GHC 9.6.7 bindists. All that's left is our GPG signature and an upload to [https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/).

Luite: Started working on consolidating infrastructure for tools that query the C toolchain, such as `hsc2hs` and `deriveConstants`, to make them faster and more maintainable.

Sylvain: resumed work on making `INLINE` pragmas ignore function arity. Seee
[GHC#23150](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23150) and
[GHC!11776](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11776).

Sylvain: started investigated making Uniques more deterministic in GHC to allow
caching intermediate representations in the compilation pipeline more easily.

Sylvain: minor refactoring of partial functions in GHC. See [GHC#25743](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25743) and [GHC!13969](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13969). The refactoring had some issue later fixed by Matthew Pickering. See [GHC#25829](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25829) and [GHC!14071](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/14071).
