Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

Sylvain: completed the work to make a GHC built with cabal-install pass the
testsuite. See https://github.com/stable-haskell/ghc/pull/3 There is some more
work to be done to build a complete binary distribution: building several RTS
ways, etc.

Luite: [Announced](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2025-February/021939.html) [GHC 9.6.7 rc2](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.6.7-rc2/) with a small fix to make Haskell Language Server work again. It's also available on the [ghcup prereleases](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/guide/#metadata) channel. Please give this release a try and open a ticket if you find anything amiss!

Luite: Implemented efficient packing of smaller fields of unboxed sums and using less than a word for the tag. This saves space if you `{-# UNPACK #-}` things in your data constructors. See [GHC!13926](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13926).

Luite: Looked into using [cosmopolitan libc](https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html) to see if we can make a GHC cross compiler that produces multi-arch/os binaries (continuing earlier work by Sylvain). We can produce basic APE binaries that run on Linux already, but it will require a lot of work disabling system dependent code from Haskell libraries and the GHC runtime system to make them actually run on multiple operating systems. It's not yet clear if we will continue down this path.

Sylvain: resumed work on making `INLINE` pragmas ignore function arity. Seee
[GHC#23150](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23150) and
[GHC!11776](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11776).

Sylvain: started investigated making Uniques more deterministic in GHC to allow
caching intermediate representations in the compilation pipeline more easily.

Sylvain: minor refactoring of partial functions in GHC. See [GHC#25743](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25743) and [GHC!13969](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13969). The refactoring had some issue later fixed by Matthew Pickering. See [GHC#25829](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25829) and [GHC!14071](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/14071).
