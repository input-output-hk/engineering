## Performance

- Sylvain: I've noticed that fusion wasn't happening for `enumFrom*` methods on 32-bit targets (e.g. JavaScript).
  For example, `foo = sum [0..123456] :: Word64` was compiling into slow code using `Integer` operations (see [GHC#23578](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23578)).
  Jaro has made [a fix](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10825) for the fusion operation (thanks!).
  However it turned out that the JS implementation of 64-bit operations is sometimes slower than using `Integer` operations
  (see [GHC#23597](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23597)) so fixing fusion made the JS code slower!
  See Jaro's [benchmark's results](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/187#issuecomment-1637560782).
  I've updated the implementation of `plusWord64` to fix this specific case (see [GHC!10873](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10873)).
  With my fix we get a x3.5 speedup on the previous example and with Jaro's fusion fix we get another x5.4 speedup.
  Overall, from 4.8s to 0.25s!

## CI / Testsuite

- Sylvain: implemented `getMonotonicTimeNSec` in JavaScript. See [GHC#23687](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23687)
  and [GHC!10900](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10900).
  Found while working on `unix`'s package testsuite.
- Luite: ran the testsuite for the JavaScript target with strict mode (`"use strict"`) on node.js and found some missing declarations that went unnoticed when running in regular mode. Pushed a few fixes. See [GHC#23775](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23775) and [GHC!11028](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11028).

## Incomplete Record Selectors

## Miscellaneous

- Sylvain: fixed tow typos in CPP constants used by the JS rts (noticed by Luite). These would only be problematic in uncommon erroring circumstances, explaining why they haven't been caught earlier.
  See [GHC#23650](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23650) and [GHC!10862](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10862).
