Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

## High-level Summary

This is our sprint after attending Zurihac and an IOG meetup in Zurich. The team
was getting back into the groove but was in a holding pattern. Luite was on
vacation for almost the entire sprint, Sylvain for one week, and Jeff contracted covid (again!) and was
similarly out.

## Details

Jeff: Began migrating the patches in Haskell.nix to GHC head. In total there are
271 patches across numerous platforms and GHC versions. However most of these
patches are duplicates, meaning that the same patch is listed in Haskell.nix for
say GHC-9.8 and GHC-9.10. So we do not need to migrate such a patch twice. Jeff
has finished opening branches to prepare for MRs on all the easily applied
patches.

Jeff: Fixed a [bug](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/324384) in the
GHC-8.10.7 derivation in nixpkgs. If you've ever seen GHCi complain
"freeHaskellFunctionPtr: not for me, guv!" then is one is for you.

Sylvain: Fixed a bug in
[atomic-primops](https://github.com/rrnewton/haskell-lockfree/pull/91) that was
causing GHC-9.10 to hang.

Sylvain: Fixed a fairly long-standing bug in GHC that caused a build with DWARF
symbols and no tables-next-to-code to no longer build. This was noticed by Jeff
while writing the [perf
chapter](https://haskell.foundation/hs-opt-handbook.github.io/src/Measurement_Observation/Binary_Profiling/linux_perf.html#perf-chapter)
of the haskell optimization handbook. [GHC#22792](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22792) [GHC!12641](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12641)

Sylvain: Resurrected Ben's former MR that issues deprecation warnings for
primops. Previously, haddock in `ghc-prim` would show these deprecation warnings but GHC wouldn't warn at their use sites. This
is now fixed; so now a warning will be issued to the user if they use a deprecated primop. [GHC#19629](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/19629) [GHC!5548](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/5548).
So uses of deprecated primops in boot libraries have been fixed in the process (e.g. [array!28](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/packages/array/-/merge_requests/28)).

Luite: Was on vacation getting lost in the mountains of Switzerland.
