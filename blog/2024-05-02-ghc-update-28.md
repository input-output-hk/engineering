Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

<!-- truncate -->

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

- Sylvain: completed and merged someone's patch opened for 4 years to make GHC
  generate better LLVM IR for complete switches.
  [GHC#24717](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24717),
  [GHC!12491](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12491).

- Sylvain: fixed issue with code using DeriveLift and when building
  template-haskell.
  [GHC#22229](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22229),
  [GHC!12456](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12456).

- Sylvain: fixed a segfault in GHCi when using breakpoints.
  [GHC#24712](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24712),
  [GHC!12500](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12500)

- Sylvain: fixed a JS codegen issue because GHC generates code that computes
  with RUBBISH literals. There may be more to it as it's not really supposed to
  happen, but at least the generated JS code is valid code now .
  [GHC#24664](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24664),
  [GHC!12463](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12463).

- Jeff: After a long exhausting battle with the GHC testsuite, jeff expanded the testsuite capabilites to track binary sizes for each backend in GHC's CI and their dependencies. [MR](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12372#c591f85f122007bac88228c5ff6fd76b40e6a811) is merging now.

- Jeff: Published the [perf](https://haskell.foundation/hs-opt-handbook.github.io/src/Measurement_Observation/Binary_Profiling/linux_perf.html#perf-chapter) chapter for the [Haskell Optimization Handbook](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/hs-opt-handbook.github.io).

- Hamish: added support for the JS backend in Miso
  [Miso#738](https://github.com/dmjio/miso/pull/738). This led to a discussion
  about generated code size. Sylvain opened two issues about ideas to reduce
  code size ([GHC#24743](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24743) and
  [GHC#24744](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24744)) and one MR to
  prepare for #24743
  [GHC!12538](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12538).

- Luite: Made a new implementation of the functionality of starting/stopping
  profiling counters for cost centre profiling [GHC!12478](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12478).
  This implementation is simpler than the previous one [GHC!12440](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12440),
  but requires reading a global variable for each counter increment. Initial performance
  measurements have shown that the cost is minor. We haven't merged this yet because of ongoing
  work on even finer control of cost centre counters (multiple counters per cost centre stack and per-thread
  settings), which might supersede this patch.
