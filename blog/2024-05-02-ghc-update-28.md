## High level summary


## Details

- Sylvain: completed and merged someone's patch opened for 4 years to make GHC
  generate better LLVM IR for complete switches.
  [GHC#24717](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24717),
  [GHC!12491](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12491).

- Sylvain: fixed issue with code using DeriveLift and when building
  template-haskell.
  [GHC#22229](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22229),
  [GHC!12456](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12456).

- Sylvain: fixed a segfault in GHCi when using breakpoints.
  [GHC#24712](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24712),
  [GHC!12500](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12500)

- Sylvain: fixed a JS codegen issue because GHC generates code that computes
  with RUBBISH literals. There may be more to it as it's not really supposed to
  happen, but at least the generated JS code is valid code now .
  [GHC#24664](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24664),
  [GHC!12463](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12463).

- Hamish: added support for the JS backend in Miso
  [Miso#738](https://github.com/dmjio/miso/pull/738). This led to a discussion
  about generated code size. Sylvain opened two issues about ideas to reduce
  code size ([GHC#24743](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24743) and
  [GHC#24744](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24744)) and one MR to
  prepare for #24743
  [GHC!12538](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12538).
