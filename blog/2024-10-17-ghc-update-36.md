Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

## High-level Summary

We confirmed that speculative evaluation ([GHC#25284](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25284) is indeed causing the Cardano node performance regression and that there are no other blocking performance issues. This means that we can upgrade Cardano to GHC 9.6 once we have a release with a backported fix.

## Details

### Code generation

Sylvain: fixed z-encoding of tuple symbols issue leading to overlong symbols.
[GHC#25364](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25364)
[GHC!13404](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13404).

Jeff: Swapped the use of lists with an OrdList [GHC!13221](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13221) GHC's code generator. Unfortunately, this led to a 2% increase in compile time allocations which is unavoidable due to the need to pattern match on pattern synonyms that allocate a new spine for the OrdList. Trying to make the OrdList more strict does not work because the knot tying in the Cmm Parser requires a certain amount of laziness, and OrdList is used throughout the code generator. Thus, changes in the OrdList's strictness impact the knot tying and can make the compiler loop. See [GHC#19245](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/19245) for more knot tying mayhem.

### GHC/Base Stability
Jeff: Added an RTS flag, called `--optimistic-linking` to make the runtime linker less conservative. [GHC!13012](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13012).

Jeff: Got CLC approval to improve the stability of base by removing GHC's RTS flags out of base and into `ghc-experimental`. The present flag api in `base` will be unchanged and deprecated. This work lays the groundwork for the transition. New flags will be exposed through `ghc-experimental` instead of `base`. [GHC!13428](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13428).


### Template Haskell / GHCi interpreter

Luite: added locking in the communication with the external interpreter. This
fixes errors and deadlocks when using Template Haskell in combination with
parallel (`-j`) builds. Ticket/MR TODO!

### JavaScript backend

Sylvain: [started writing a blog
post](https://github.com/input-output-hk/engineering/pull/96) to showcase the
JavaScript backend feature allowing it to compile and to link with C sources
compiled to WebAssembly/JavaScript. Once completed it will be published on this
blog.

### Binary Sizes

Jeff: Made the `SrcLoc` data type more strict, which allowed GHC to automatically unpack certain fields. This yields about a 7% reduction in certain boot libraries like `exception`. See (GHC!13381)[https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13381), this also closes (CLC!55)[https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/55). While that works we can still go farther. (GHC!13438)[https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13438] tries to squeeze these fields into just two machine words (instead of 12); this is still in draft though.
