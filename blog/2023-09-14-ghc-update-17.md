Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## ICFP

Most of the team was at ICFP 2023 last week!

Jeff presented at Funarch workshop. TODO fill some details + link to paper

TODO: other things to mention? Tooling?

## JS backend

Sylvain: updated the [wiki
page](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/javascript-backend/bug_triage)
about GHC tests still failing with the JS backend. Some failures were due to
issues with the tests themselves (Cabal not finding the right `ghc-pkg` program
to use) and have been fixed in
[GHC!11193](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11193).
