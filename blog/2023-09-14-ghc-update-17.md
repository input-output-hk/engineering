Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

## ICFP

Most of the team was at ICFP 2023 last week!

Jeff presented our paper [Stretching the Glasgow Haskell Compiler: Nourishing GHC with Domain-Driven Design](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3609025.3609476) at the Funarch workshop colocated with ICFP. This paper is a 6 page version of our white paper [Modularizing GHC](https://hsyl20.fr/home/files/papers/2022-ghc-modularity.pdf). It establishes anti-modular anti-patterns that we have found while modularizing GHC, discusses why these anti-patterns are problematic, and provides recommendation for other functional language software architects.

TODO: other things to mention? Tooling?

## Performance

Sylvain: added some missing rewrite rules for cheaper Int64/Word64 to Float/Double conversions.
See [GHC#23907](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23907), [GHC!11170](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11170), and [CLC proposal #203](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/203).

## GHC build

Hamish tried to build GHC head with haskell.nix and faced an issue with conflicting rules: two source files (`Stack.cmm` and `Stack.c`) would produce the same output object code (`Stack.o`).
This isn't an issue for GHC which uses its adhoc build system which produces `cmm/Stack.o` and `c/Stack.o` in this case. But it is for Haskell.nix and cabal-install.
See [GHC#23898](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23898) and [GHC!11160](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11160) for Sylvain's fix.

## JS backend

Sylvain: updated the [wiki
page](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/javascript-backend/bug_triage)
about GHC tests still failing with the JS backend. Some failures were due to
issues with the tests themselves (Cabal not finding the right `ghc-pkg` program
to use) and have been fixed in
[GHC!11193](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11193).
