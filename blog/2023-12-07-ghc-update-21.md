Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

## Performance

Josh: worked on a tool to benchmark various configurations of tools in the Haskell ecosystem.
This tool is intented to track performance changes over time - originally motivated by a
regression experienced by another team at IOG between GHC versions 8.10 and and 9.2. When
completed, this tool will automatically run all permutations of the inputs and graph the results.

Sylvain: investigated and closed [GHC#21041](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/21041) as the suggested change doesn't improve performance

Jeff: Helped the cardano team with performance engineering the cardano-ledger. Tested two prospective patches and observed good evidence that one patch is worthy of further testing. 

Luite: Reimplemented the Z-encoder in Haskell and C for a 10-20x speedup over the
existing implementation. This allows us to remove the cached Z-encoded strings from the
FastString table, reducing the amount of non-reclaimable memory used in a GHC
session [GHC!11681](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11681)

## Maintenance

Sylvain: closed most
[tickets](https://gitlab.haskell.org/groups/ghc/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=Data%20Parallel%20Haskell)
related to Data Parallel Haskell (DPH) and that are no longer relevant.

Sylvain: fixed issue with STG CSE optimization [GHC#14895](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/14895),
[GHC#24233](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24233), [GHC!11715](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11715).

Sylvain: implemented `text`'s `measure_off` function in pure Haskell [text!548](https://github.com/haskell/text/pull/548)

Sylvain: investigated and closed [GHC#15485](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/15485). The upstream `unix` issue is now tracked in [unix#310](https://github.com/haskell/unix/issues/310).

Luite: fixed some foreign imports for the JS backend [GHC!11447](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11447)

Jeff: Modified the testsuite to track and record arbitrary metrics on bulid artifacts. [MR!11551](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11551) is 90% done.
