Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

Sylvain: closed most
[tickets](https://gitlab.haskell.org/groups/ghc/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=Data%20Parallel%20Haskell)
related to Data Parallel Haskell (DPH) and that are no longer relevant.

Sylvain: fixed issue with STG CSE optimization [GHC#14895](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/14895),
[GHC#24233](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24233), [GHC!11715](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11715).

Josh: worked on a tool to benchmark various configurations of tools in the Haskell ecosystem.
This tool is intented to track performance changes over time - originally motivated by a
regression experienced by another team at IOG between GHC versions 8.10 and and 9.2. When
completed, this tool will automatically run all permutations of the inputs and graph the results.

Sylvain: implemented `text`'s `measure_off` function in pure Haskell [text#548](https://github.com/haskell/text/pull/548)
