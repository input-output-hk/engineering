Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## Maintenance

Sylvain: closed most
[tickets](https://gitlab.haskell.org/groups/ghc/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=Data%20Parallel%20Haskell)
related to Data Parallel Haskell (DPH) and that are no longer relevant.


## Misc

Josh: worked on a tool to benchmark various configurations of tools in the Haskell ecosystem.
This tool is intented to track performance changes over time - originally motivated by a
regression experienced by another team at IOG between GHC versions 8.10 and and 9.2. When
completed, this tool will automatically run all permutations of the inputs and graph the results.
