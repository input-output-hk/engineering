## High-level Summary

## Details

Sylvain: fixed GHC build with `-dppr-debug` enabled (useful for debugging). [GHC#25255](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25255) [GHC!13260](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13260)

Sylvain: fixed parsing of extended literals that was too permissive (e.g. `80#Int3` would be lexed as two tokens `80#Int` and `3`). [GHC#25258](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25258) [GHC!13272](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13272)

Sylvain: fixed generation of a static closure for a datacon with an unboxed sum field (e.g. an unpacked sum type). [GHC#25166](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25166) [GHC!13146](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13146)

Luite: spent some time bisecting to find out why `cardano-node` is slower with recent GHC. It turned out to be speculative evaluation having a detrimental effect on allocations. [GHC#25284](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25284)

### haskell.nix patches

Sylvain, Jeff: upstreamed the haskell.nix patch adding some support for ELF hidden symbols in the RTS linker [GHC#25191](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25191) [GHC!13013](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13013)

Sylvain: upstreamed an adaptation of the haskell.nix patch adding support for additional RTS linker symbols. This is particularly useful for cross-compilation. See the added documentation in the patch. [GHC#25155](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25155) [GHC!13129](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13129)

Sylvain: upstreamed an haskell.nix patch fixing support for the RTS `closure_sizeW_` with the RTS linker. [GHC#25252](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25252) [GHC!13249](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13249)

### JavaScript backend

Sylvain: fixed the build system to avoid trying to use `libfii` with the JS backend for adjustors. [GHC#25159](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25159) [GHC!13224](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13224)
