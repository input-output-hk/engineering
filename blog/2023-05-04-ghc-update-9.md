Biweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## JavaScript backend

- Jeff: [MR!10260](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10260)
  work continues. The patch has stalled because of a stubborn bug in the
  optimizer. Fortunately, Jeff has found a reproducible test case. So it
  shouldn't be long until the patch is live.
  
- Josh & Sylvain: fixed the `-fcheck-prim-bound` feature for the JS backend.
[MR!10234](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10234)
  
## GHC Proposal #0134 (Deprecated Exports)

- Bartek: [GHC!10283](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10283)

## Performance

- Jeff: First case study on performance engineering for the [Haskell
Optimization
Handbook](https://input-output-hk.github.io/hs-opt-handbook.github.io/) is done
and has been published.

## Modularity

- Jeff: Has begun to consolidate the
  [ghc-modularity](https://hsyl20.fr/home/files/papers/2022-ghc-modularity.pdf)
  paper for a
  [FUNARCH](https://icfp23.sigplan.org/home/funarch-2023#Call-for-Papers)
  submission. See you at ICFP!

## Tooling

- Sylvain: fixed Stack's hi-file-parser to support GHC 9.4.5 and GHC 9.6.1. See
  ticket
  [hi-file-parser#12](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/hi-file-parser/issues/12)
  and PR
  [hi-file-parser#13](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/hi-file-parser/pull/14).
