Biweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## JavaScript backend

- Luite: has published a blog post about how Stacks work in the JS backend:
https://engineering.iog.io/2023-04-21-stacks-in-the-js-backend

- Jeff: [GHC!10260](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10260)
  work continues. The patch has stalled because of a stubborn bug in the
  optimizer. Fortunately, Jeff has found a reproducible test case. So it
  shouldn't be long until the patch is live.
  
- Josh & Sylvain: fixed the `-fcheck-prim-bound` feature for the JS backend.
See [GHC#23123](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23123) and
[GHC!10234](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10234)

- Luite: improved gc pause times for the JS backend for programs that do not
use weak references, by omitting heap scans if there are no pending finalizers.
See [GHC!10379](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10379)


- Josh: refactored some code related to saturated/unsaturated ASTs:
  - First, the `identsS`/`identsE`/`identsV` functions were changed to
    take a `Sat.JStat` instead of an `Unsat.JStat` as an argument, since
    they previously would raise an error when encountering an unsaturated
    constructor (`Sat.JStat` and `Unsat.JStat` are identical other than
    this constructor)
    [GHC#23304](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23304)
    [GHC!10348](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10348)
  - Then, `jsSaturate` and `satJStat` were combined into one function.
    Previously, `jsSaturate` would instantiate unsaturated constructors
    in a `JStat` AST, but retain the `Unsat.JStat` type, and `satJStat`
    would separately traverse the AST to make the simple type conversion.
    Since `jsSaturate` was never used without calling `satJStat` directly
    after, these can be combined to traverse the AST and instantiate
    unsaturated constructors in one pass.

## GHC Proposal #0134 (Deprecated Exports)

- Bartek: found a [bug in warnings about duplicate exports when exporting T(..)]
 (https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23318)

- Bartek: Finished exporting part of the renamer for the Deprecating Exports proposal.
See [GHC!10283](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10283)

## Performance

- Jeff: First case study on performance engineering for the [Haskell
Optimization
Handbook](https://input-output-hk.github.io/hs-opt-handbook.github.io/) is done
and has been published.

## Modularity

- Jeff: Has begun to consolidate the
  [ghc-modularity](https://hsyl20.fr/home/files/papers/2022-ghc-modularity.pdf)
  paper for a
  [FUNARCH](https://icfp23.sigplan.org/home/funarch-2023#Call-for-Papers)
  submission. See you at ICFP!

## Tooling

- Sylvain: fixed Stack's hi-file-parser to support GHC 9.4.5 and GHC 9.6.1. See
  ticket
  [hi-file-parser#12](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/hi-file-parser/issues/12)
  and PR
  [hi-file-parser#13](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/hi-file-parser/pull/14).
