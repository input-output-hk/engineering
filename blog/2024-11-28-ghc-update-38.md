## High-level Summary


## Details

### Performance

Luite: Created a stand-alone testcase for [GHC#25284](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25284) so possible mitigations can be tested quickly. Discussed some options to improve the flags we created earlier ([GHC!13556](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13556)).

Jeff: investigated variations in Plutus criterion benchmarks (possibly related to GC).

### Toolchain

Luite: Worked on preparing the upcoming GHC 9.6.7 release by backporting and testing patches: See [luite/ghc/wip/ghc-9.6-backports](https://gitlab.haskell.org/luite/ghc/-/commits/wip/ghc-9.6-backports).

Sylvain: investigated how to build GHC differently (e.g. without Hadrian). Work still in progress.

Sylvain: experimented with using HPP instead of the C toolchain as a CPP preprocessor to build GHC. I had to implement some features and to fix a few bugs to support CPP as used in the RTS:
- Add support for macros with empty argument list: [HPP#7](https://github.com/acowley/hpp/pull/7)
- Fix removal of C comments (otherwise we tried to substitute macros in them): [HPP#8](https://github.com/acowley/hpp/pull/8)
- Add support for variadic macros: [HPP#10](https://github.com/acowley/hpp/pull/10)
- Fix line counting for `__LINE__` support and `#line` token insertion: [HPP#6](https://github.com/acowley/hpp/pull/6), [HPP#11](https://github.com/acowley/hpp/pull/11) and [HPP#12](https://github.com/acowley/hpp/pull/12)

Shoutout to HPP's author and maintainer Anthony Cowley who has been very responsive.

### Maintenance

Sylvain: reviewed GHC patches about the JS backend
