## Performance


## Stability

We've published Bartek's blog post about his internship at IOG on GHC stability features: https://engineering.iog.io/2023-10-25-internship

## Maintenance

Sylvain: fixed out-of-bounds array access bug in `ghc-bignum`.
See [GHC#24066](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24066)
and [GHC!11412](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11412).

Sylvain: got access to a big-endian PowerPC architectures on the [GCC Compile
Farm](https://portal.cfarm.net/) and started debugging endianness-related [GHC bugs](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=big-endian).
See [GHC#18431](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/18431), [GHC#23387](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23387), [GHC!11473](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11473).

## JS backend

Sylvain: worked on improving support for C sources with the JS backend
(e.g. to link with `sqlite` compiled to JavaScript/Wasm with Emscripten).
The work is still in progress and you can follow progresses in
[GHC!11502](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11502).
See also related refactoring merge requests [GHC!11437](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11437)
and [GHC!11504](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11504).

Josh: merged documentation on replacing C FFI functions in libraries for the JS backend.
See [GHC!11291](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11291)

Josh: added a ticket with a task list of C functions used in boot libraries that
need to be replaced for the JS backend.
See [GHC#24015](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24015)
