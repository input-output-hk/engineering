Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

## Stability

We've published Bartek's blog post about his internship at IOG on GHC stability features: https://engineering.iog.io/2023-10-25-internship

## Maintenance

Sylvain: fixed out-of-bounds array access bug in `ghc-bignum`.
See [GHC#24066](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24066)
and [GHC!11412](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11412).

Sylvain: got access to a big-endian PowerPC architectures on the [GCC Compile
Farm](https://portal.cfarm.net/) and started debugging endianness-related [GHC bugs](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=big-endian).
See [GHC#18431](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/18431), [GHC#23387](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23387), [GHC!11473](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11473).

## JS backend

Sylvain: worked on improving support for C sources with the JS backend
(e.g. to link with `sqlite` compiled to JavaScript/Wasm with Emscripten).
The work is still in progress and you can follow progresses in
[GHC!11502](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11502).
See also related refactoring merge requests [GHC!11437](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11437)
and [GHC!11504](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11504).

Josh: merged documentation on replacing C FFI functions in libraries for the JS backend.
See [GHC!11291](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11291)

Josh: added a ticket with a task list of C functions used in boot libraries that
need to be replaced for the JS backend.
See [GHC#24015](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24015)

Jeff: Finished [splitting](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22736) the JS Backend IR, `JStat`, into two: `JStg` and `JStat`. This substantially cleans up the JS backend's DSL and makes it harder to write unsafe code in the DSL. More importantly this patch paves the way for the optimizer and for a more robust typed eDSL to express the JS Backend's runtime system in. See [GHC!22736](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10722) for more.

Luite: Worked on bringing back an optimizer for the JS backend. The goal is
to reduce code size and memory consumption during linking. An initial version
reduced code size of a "hello world" program by 26.9%, and additional analysis
should improve this more. See [GHC!11507](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11507)
