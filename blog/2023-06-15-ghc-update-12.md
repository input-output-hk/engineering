Biweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## GHC contributors' workshop & Zurihac

- Sylvain: had a great time presenting the JavaScript backend at the GHC
  contributors' workshop and discussing various Haskell/GHC related things at
  Zurihac. It was nice to meet so many familiar nicknames in person!
  Slides and examples can be found [here](https://github.com/hsyl20/ghc-workshop-2023).

## JavaScript backend

- Sylvain: updated the MR implementing Template Haskell for the JS backend
  [!9779](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9779) to add
  a workaround for recompilation avoidance issues. We hope to get this MR merged
  before the GHC 9.8 fork (tomorrow).
 
- Sylvain: has been doing some bug triage in the testsuite. Now the result can
  be accessed and modifierd directly on the [wiki](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/javascript-backend/bug_triage)
  (it was in a Google doc before).

- Luite: fixed a few IO related bugs, including one that caused threads to be
  unreachable by asynchronous exceptions such as timeout.
  [GHC!10657](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10657)
  
- Luite: fixed file descriptor sharing and signal handling for the `process` package
  on node.js, among many smaller changes and fixes. The testsuite for the `process`
  package now passes on the JavaScript target. Some work remains before it can be
  merged, mostly around error handling and documentation, but the package should be
  generally usable now.
  [GHC#22349](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22349),
  [luite/process/js WIP branch GitHub](https://github.com/luite/process/tree/js).

- Josh: updated JavaScript FFI import strings in the `posix` library to use modern
  JavaScript backend syntax.
  See: [!10590](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10590)

- Josh: worked on updating `ghcjs-base` to work with the JavaScript backend. This library
  is the first step in updating the GHCJS ecosystem for the JavaScript backend, such as
  `ghcjs-dom`.
  See: [ghcjs-base!134](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs-base/pull/134)
  
- Jeff: Root caused JavaScript backend CI perf tests not being run. Perf tests should be enabled again soon. MR [here](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10576)

- Jeff: Continued splitting the JavaScript backend into an eDSL and IR for codegen/optimizations. Not ready for MR yet, but this will be a fairly large code churn.

## Deprecation warnings

- Bartek: Trying to get the last changes through and fixing minor comments from Sam.
  See [GHC!10283](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10283)

## Incomplete Record Selectors

- Bartek: started work on the [incomplete record selectors propolal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0516-incomplete-record-selectors.rst),
 reading through the desugarer code

- Bartek: crunching through the [pattern match checker paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3408989)

- Bartek: investigating the issue where the code handling the incomplete record updates warning was removed.
  See [GHC#23520](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23520)


## Miscellaneous

- Jeff: Continued trying to add ANSI Hyperlinks for the Haskell Error Index [here](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10395). We hope to get this merged into the GHC 9.8 fork.
