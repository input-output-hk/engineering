## JavaScript backend

### Template Haskell

Sylvain continued his work on the implementation of Template Haskell for the JS
backend. He factorized the code from `iserv` and `libiserv` into the `ghci`
library. This makes it easy for GHC to load and run the external interpreter
server (`iserv`) that ends up compiled into JavaScript in a NodeJS instance. He
modified GHC to avoid creating ByteCode objects (which are unsupported by the JS
backend) and to instead compile and link JavaScript code.

Template Haskell basically works with the JavaScript backend now, except for a few
corner cases (such as one-shot mode), but these should be fixed in the coming
days/weeks.

Luite modified Sylvain's JavaScript code to fix support for Darwin and Windows. If you
want to test it, a draft merge request has been opened:
https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9779

### JavaScript backend in the browser tutorial

Josh published a tutorial about using code produced by the JavaScript backend in a web
page:
https://engineering.iog.io/2023-01-24-javascript-browser-tutorial


### Cabal support for js-sources

Sylvain added tests to his patch that adds cabal support for the `js-sources`
stanza when GHC is used as a compiler (and not only when GHCJS is used as a
compiler), allowing the patch to be merged:
https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/8636

https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/8639 is still open though so be careful
if you try to use `js-sources`, they still don't work in some cases.


### JavaScript backend CI

The [JavaScript backend
CI](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9552) has been an
ongoing saga for the last month, and has been a blocking item for JavaScript
Backend development. Thankfully it is close to being merged. This week, Jeff
rebased the CI to discover that recent
[changes](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/commit/d31fcbca6cf4bc166904cfd25696503401ad631d)
removed `nodejs` (the `node` that is bundled with emscripten) from the CI
containers `$PATH`. So Jeff patched the CI images to add `node`. Now the CI runs
and has discovered two new bugs even before being merged. All that is left is to
bump some submodules and the CI will be ready to land in GHC HEAD.


### FileStat

Josh opened an MR to match the layout of the JavaScript `fileStat` with the
layout of the equivalent struct defined in Emscripten's `stat.h`. This is needed
to ensure that hsc2hs features work correctly with this data type. Hsc2hs features
can peek at memory locations directly without using accessor functions, and the
memory locations are taken from the header file, hence the requirement to match
these layouts.

This MR only touches JavaScript files, so we're waiting on the approval of the
JS CI before continuing. For more information, see
https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22573

### JavaScript RTS refactor

Josh refactored parts of the GHC.StgtoJS.Rts.Rts module to remove special cases
from one of the n-argument JavaScript RTS functions, and combined these cases
into a general case. Thus, simplifying the Rts module's code.

Josh also improved the caching in the JavaScript Backend for commonly used names
in the generated JavaScript ASTs. Previously, names such as `x1` would require
allocation _for each_ use: first by allocating a `String`, which was then
converted to a GHC `FastString`, which was finally wrapped in a JavaScript AST
data constructor. Now, these names are captured in a static CAF'd `Array` and
each reference was replaced with a lookup to the corresponding slot in the
array. This avoids the extra allocations and ensures these names are shared.

For the full set of refactors, see:
https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22822

### JavaScript EDSL

Jeff began work on a new eDSL to replace the existing DSL the JavaScript Backend
inherited from GHCJS. This solves a [design
problem](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22736). The existing DSL in
the JavaScript Backend is used for two things: (1) to write the JavaScript
Backend's garbage collector, runtime system and other low level bits; (2) as a
target for optimizations; (3) as the source for code generation. This becomes
problematic because the existing DSL tries to do so much that it ends up not
being particularly good at (1), (2) and (3).

The fix is to separate concerns by writing a new DSL for (1). The DSL is Type
Safe and based on the [Sunroof
compiler](https://github.com/ku-fpg/sunroof-compiler) (Thanks Andy Gill et al.
for your labor!). Then, we'll compile the new DSL to the existing GHCJS DSL.
This way we can slowly begin to replace JavaScript Backend code module by
module, thus gaining type safety while still continuing other work. The end game
of this project is to eventually remove the GHCJS DSL entirely and then compile
our new DSL to a better intermediate representation that is explicitly crafted
to make optimizations easier.

### Blog posts

Luite has been working on new blog posts about internals of the GHC JavaScript
backend and a strategy guide for debugging the generated JavaScript code. These
will be published in the coming weeks.

### JavaScript backend configuration issue in a Docker image

Sylvain debugged a configuration issue of GHC with the JavaScript backend (see
[#22814](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22814)).
The recommended way to configure is to use the following command line:

```
emconfigure ./configure --target=js-unknown-ghcjs
```

where `emconfigure` is provided by the Emscripten project and sets appropriate
environment variables (CC, LD, AR...).

However in some cases it seems like these variables are set as follows:

```
CC=emcc
LD=emcc
...
```

in which case GHC's `configure` script will silently ignores them... and uses
the C compiler for the host platform instead (x86-64, aarch64...). As the C
compiler is only used for the CPP pass, it results in some inscrutable errors.
In [#22814](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22814) the error is due
to `CSize` being inferred as a 64-bit type while it should be 32-bit for the
JavaScript platform, leading to CSize values being passed as 2 arguments in FFI
calls while the callee expects 1.

Calling `configure` with the right environment variables fixes the issue:

```
./configure CC=$(which emcc) LD=$(which emcc) --target=js-unknown-ghcjs
```


### Discussion about JavaScript backend maturity

Quite some time was spent discussing users' expectations about the JavaScript and WASM backends.
We would like to make it very clear that even if GHCJS has been here for a long time,
the JavaScript backend doesn't yet have the same level of maturity.

Bugs, missing features, and sub-par performance are to be expected in the 9.6 release.
We encourage adventurous users to try out this release and send us feedback, but it's
best to exercise caution before relying on it for production.

## Compiler performance

### More-strict `break`

Josh did more investigation into the performance difference that introducing
some strictness into the `break` function would make. The STG and microbenchmarks
are very promising, but using the "compile cabal" benchmark, there doesn't seem
to be a noticable time difference caused by the change. In terms of memory, it
seems to reduce GC copying, but slightly increase overall allocations and total
memory usage.

There's pathological cases in using a strict break by default - for example in the
`lines` function. Because of this, it's likely that this optimization would have
the most benefit if applied in isolated cases in GHC, if any pathological lazy
cases are found.

## Misc

### Cross-compilation from Linux/Darwin to Windows

Ticket [#22805](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22805) reminded Sylvain that he had made [MR !9310](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9310) more than two months ago to fix the same issue: cross-compilation from Linux/Darwin to Windows. The MR has now been updated, tested, reviewed, and merged.

### Hadrian rules to build the Sphinx-based docs

Sylvain started working on adding a chapter about the JavaScript in GHC's Users Guide.
The first step was to fix Hadrian's build rules for the Users Guide ([MR !9795](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9795))
