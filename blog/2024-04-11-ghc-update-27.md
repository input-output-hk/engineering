Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

## High level summary

We continued with the `cardano-node` performance regression investigation and ran
more benchmarks and comparisons. We confirmed that the `Crypto` typeclass
parameterization is causing a significant performance overhead and that specializing
to `StandardCrypto` in a few places reduces allocations by 50% on GHC 9.6. The
performance gap between GHC 8.10 and GHC 9.6 is completely closed by doing this
optimization. Because of this result, the `cardano-ledger` team is now considering
removing the `Crypto` typeclass in a future release.

## Details

- Hamish: released new versions of
  [ghcjs-base](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghcjs-base),
  [ghcjs-dom-javascript](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghcjs-dom-javascript),
  [ghcjs-dom](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghcjs-dom),
  [jsaddle](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/jsaddle),
  [jsaddle-dom](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/jsaddle-dom)... that are
  compatible with GHC's JavaScript backend.

- Jeff: assisted a GHC contributor into adding support Google Closure Compiler
  in GHC's CI.
  [!12330](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12330)
  
- Jeff: Made more efforts to align the ghc.nix developer environment with the dependency versions that GHC runs on CI. [#190](https://github.com/alpmestan/ghc.nix/pull/190)
  
- Sylvain/Luite: fixed tricky bug in the JS codegen and reenabled the relevant optimization with was independently disabled in 9.10 [#24495](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24495) [!12308](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12308)

- Luite: Implemented functionality to request ticky counters to be written at specific times to the GHC eventlog. An earlier version of this
  was used for `cardano-node` performance investigation. [#24645](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24645)
  [!12399](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12399)

- Luite: Working on fixes for ticky counters in `ghc-events`.
  [ghc-events/tree/fix-ticky](https://github.com/luite/ghc-events/tree/fix-ticky)

- Luite: Made a utilities package to quickly test and compare optimizations in `cardano-node` and its dependencies using various profiling techniques.
  [cardano-bench-utils](https://github.com/luite/cardano-bench-utils/)

- Luite: Fixed ticky allocation counting. GHC was bumping the wrong counter.
  [#24587](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24587) [!12177](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12177)
