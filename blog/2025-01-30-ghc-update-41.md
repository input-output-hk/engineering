## High-level Summary

This sprint, work on releasing GHC 9.6.7 and on building GHC with Cabal has
continued. GHC 9.6.7 should be released very soon now. We can now build GHC and
boot libraries with cabal-install, paving the way to reinstallable boot
libraries.

## Details

Luite: has completed the GHC 9.6.7 release. See
[GHC#25559](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25559) and
[GHC!13740](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13740).

Sylvain: worked on bootstrapping GHC and boot libraries with cabal-install. I
managed to build a stage2 non-cross compiler with it. There are still a lot of
rough edges to improve though. YOu can follow progresses on
[stable-haskell:ghc#3](https://github.com/stable-haskell/ghc/pull/3)

Sylvain: the merge of the `ghc-prim` package into `ghc-internal` has finally be
completed. See [GHC#24453](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24453)
and [GHC!13752](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13752)
