## JavaScript backend

- Sylvain: helped fixing support for cross-compilers in GHCup: compilation and installation of a cross-compiler from source and from bindists. Most of the work was done by Julian (GHCup's maintainer). See [GHCup#844](https://github.com/haskell/ghcup-hs/pull/844), [GHCup#838](https://github.com/haskell/ghcup-hs/issues/838), [GHCup#845](https://github.com/haskell/ghcup-hs/pull/845). JS backend support in GHCup can be tested via pre-release channels following instructions in https://github.com/haskell/ghcup-metadata/pull/98#issuecomment-1632214888.

Note that all GHC compilers (including JavaScript and Windows cross-compilers) can be easily used from the Nix environments we provide: see https://github.com/input-output-hk/devx#compilers-and-flavours

- Sylvain: implemented support for `rmdir` and fixed some issues with `lstat`. [GHC!10803](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10803)

- Sylvain: refactored and cleaned up the code responsible for converting Haskell types into their JavaScript representation. [GHC!10806](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10806) and [GHC#23314](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23314).

- Sylvain: fixed a bug in the JS linker that was assuming that the unit-id of a program was always `main`. This is no longer true to support multiple home-units. [GHC#23613](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23613) and [GHC!10819](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10819).

- Sylvain: fixed support for utimes/futimes/lutimes in `unix` library to support `touchFd` on JavaScript target (to fix Ben's [GHC!9237](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9237)). Not yet merged because it lacks CI (this triggered the work on fixing ghcup). [Unix#285](https://github.com/haskell/unix/pull/285).

- Jeff: Re-enabled the CI perf tests for the JS Backend. These were accidentally disabled because in Josh fixed a bug in the testsuite that treated the JavaScript backend as a Stage1 compiler, which it is. But Stage1 compilers are built with assertions and thus the testsuite does not track performance metrics. The [fix](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10820) changes the JavaScript backend CI to add a debug job and a release job which tracks the performance metrics.

- Luite: Looked into some file access failures that caused the JavaScript CI pipeline to fail and found a related issue of platform compatibility, because of mode flags in the `stat` struct. [GHC#23651](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23651)

- Luite: Looked into CI breakage and found that `emsdk` 3.1.42 has some changes in data layout relative to 3.1.41. In particular changes in the `stat` struct were causing file operations to fail. CI is fixed now by pinning it to 3.1.40, but work is still ongoing to make sure that we can handle a wider `emsdk` version range and to test for a compatible version at installation time. [GHC#23649](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23649)

- Josh: fixed an issue where `toJSString` didn't support unicode code points that take up more than one UTF-16 value (i.e. values greater than 2^16).
See:
[GHC#23628](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23628)
[GHC!10838](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10838)

- Josh: fixed an issue where `Buffer`s in `ghcjs-base` were producing incorrect results. This was a result of changes between GHCJS and the JavaScript backend:
  - `Addr#` is now a pair of `(pointer, offset)` and is passed as function arguments
  - A value was being returned as a `MK_TUP2`, which is a JavaScript macro that expands to apply the Haskell `(,)` constructor. This is no longer supported in the JavaScript backend, in favour of `RETURN_UBX_TUP2`, which is another macro that returns multiple values in an unboxed way through the JavaScript RTS.
 
## Incomplete Record Selectors

- Bartek: The Incomplete Record Selectors MR is now ready to be merged,
See [10736](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10736)

## Deprecated Instances

- Bartek: A lot of the major work done for the Deprecated Instances, will soon be creating a MR for it
- Bartek: Some investigation of how interface tidying can potentially affect this proposal and the [Deprecated Exports proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0134-deprecating-exports-proposal.rst), See [GHC!10844](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10844)

## Miscellaneous

- Jeff: Continued [work](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10395) on adding Haskell Error Index links to GHC's error messages. Almost done, only windows is failing on CI.

- Work on several reported bugs is moving forward,
