## JavaScript backend

- Sylvain: helped fixing support for cross-compilers in GHCup: compilation and installation of a cross-compiler from source and from bindists. Most of the work was done by Julian (GHCup's maintainer). See [GHCup#844](https://github.com/haskell/ghcup-hs/pull/844), [GHCup#838](https://github.com/haskell/ghcup-hs/issues/838), [GHCup#845](https://github.com/haskell/ghcup-hs/pull/845). JS backend support can be tested via pre-release channels following instructions in https://github.com/haskell/ghcup-metadata/pull/98#issuecomment-1632214888

- Sylvain: implemented support for `rmdir` and fixed some issues with `lstat`. [GHC!10803](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10803)
