## JavaScript backend

- Sylvain: helped fixing support for cross-compilers in GHCup: compilation and installation of a cross-compiler from source and from bindists. Most of the work was done by Julian (GHCup's maintainer). See [GHCup#844](https://github.com/haskell/ghcup-hs/pull/844), [GHCup#838](https://github.com/haskell/ghcup-hs/issues/838), [GHCup#845](https://github.com/haskell/ghcup-hs/pull/845). JS backend support can be tested via pre-release channels following instructions in https://github.com/haskell/ghcup-metadata/pull/98#issuecomment-1632214888

- Sylvain: implemented support for `rmdir` and fixed some issues with `lstat`. [GHC!10803](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10803)

- Sylvain: refactored and cleaned up the code responsible for converting Haskell types into their JavaScript representation. [GHC!10806](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10806) and [GHC#23314](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23314).

- Sylvain: fixed a bug in the JS linker that was assuming that the unit-id of a program was always `main`. This is no longer true to support multiple home-units. [GHC#23613](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23613) and [GHC!10819](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10819).

- Sylvain: fixed support for utimes/futimes/lutimes in `unix` library to support `touchFd` on JavaScript target (to fix Ben's [GHC!9237](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9237)). Not yet merged because it lacks CI (this triggered the work on fixing ghcup). [Unix#285](https://github.com/haskell/unix/pull/285).
