## Details

Luite: Has been investigating a [cardano-node](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node) performance regression caused by upgrading from GHC 8.10 to GHC 9.6. Much of the work was related to improving ways we can measure performance of Haskell programs compiled with GHC. We hope we can merge some of the improvements into GHC in the future.

Luite: JSTG optimizer has been merged after some small improvements and fixes: [GHC!11507](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11507).
