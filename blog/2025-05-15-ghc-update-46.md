Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

<!-- truncate -->

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

Sylvain: continued the experimentation with using `zig cc/c++` as a C/C++
cross-compiler with GHC to build boot libraries. I manage to cross-build libffi (a
dependency of the RTS) with a [libffi fork](https://github.com/vezel-dev/libffi)
that supports Zig's build system.

Sylvain: experimented with the addition of a `--target` flag to GHC to select a
target. Also added `--list-targets` to list the available targets. This is not
ready to be upstreamed yet.
[stable-GHC#30](https://github.com/stable-haskell/ghc/issues/30#issuecomment-2851324370)

Luite: Working on more efficient packing of heap objects by reordering
smaller-than-word fields and reducing the size of tag fields of unboxed sums and
unpacked constructors.

Sylvain: worked on a fix for the compilation of C files with GHC when no RTS unit is present. [GHC#26018](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26018), [GHC!14300](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/14300)

Sylvain: deprecated an internal module exposed from `base`.
