Biweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## JavaScript backend

- Josh: Merged a port of `clock_gettime` from GHCJS into the JavaScript backend. This
function is required by some Cabal `Setup.hs` programs, so this brings us closer to
full Cabal functionality, as well as Unix parity.
See [GHC!10396](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10396)

- Luite: Ported the patch to support the `process` package in the GHC JavaScript
backend from GHCJS. The old code was never fully tested and only intended to support
Cabal, so there is missing functionality and error reporting is lacking. Work is
now on the way to bring it up to level where it can be merged in the `process` package.

- Luite: Looked into the test failures for the JavaScript specific weak references.
It turned out to be caused by messing deadlock detection. Experimented with making
the JavaScript storage manager (`FinalizationRegistry`) work for deadlock detection,add
but it requires signifcant changes to the representation of `ThreadId#` in the Haskell
code. For GHC 9.8 we will most likely document that deadlocks are not guaranteed to
be detected with the JavaScript backend, and give the user the option to manually run
full deadlock detection (heap scan) if desired.

- Sylvain: fixed support for the `ghcjs_HOST_OS` CPP conditional.
See [GHC#22346](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23346)
and [GHC!10430](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10430).

- Sylvain: fixed `getpid`. See [GHC#23399](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23399) and [GHC!10454](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10454).

## Deprecation warnings

- Bartek: changed the way warning reporting from addUsedGRE was done from artificially removing all warning categories from dynflags to an explicit argument
See [GHC!10414](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10414)

- Bartek: almost finished the deprecated exports proposal, a bug left to fix in backpack
See [GHC!10283](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10283)

## Performance

- Josh: Merged improvements to the implementation of handle encoders after approval of
the CLC. By manually unboxing functions stored in the `CodeBuffer` record, the
allocations caused by allocations are reduced by ~20%, and general GHC usage is also
slightly improved.
See [GHC!9948](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9948)
and [CI Performance Tests](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/jobs/1514795#L6775)

## Linker

- Sylvain: backported fix for [GHC#19421](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/19421) (`internal error: m32_allocator_init: Failed to map`) to 9.2. See [GHC!10453](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10453)

## Misc.

- Jeff: First draft of the [GHC Modularity](https://hsyl20.fr/home/files/papers/2022-ghc-modularity.pdf) FUNARCH paper is complete.
