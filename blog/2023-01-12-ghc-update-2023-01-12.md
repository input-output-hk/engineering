Starting in 2023 we–the IOG GHC DevX team–are going to provide biweekly updates
about our work. This is the first edition.

## JS backend

### JS backend in the browser tutorial

We are working on a draft of a JS backend tutorial about using it to build a
simple web application: https://github.com/input-output-hk/engineering/pull/24

Publication is expected next week.

### Cabal support for js-sources

Sylvain made a patch to add cabal support for the `js-sources` stanza when
GHC is used as a compiler (and not only when GHCJS is used as a compiler):
https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/8636

It’s missing tests and then it should be ready to be merged.

### JS backend CI

Jeff worked on adding a proper CI job that runs the full testsuite
with the JS backend. Cf ticket
[#22128](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22128) and merge request
[!9552](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9552).

He had to fix some unexpected test passes (!) with the JS backend due to an
imprecise `req_smp` predicate used by the testsuite. More details on
[#22630](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22630) and
[!9568](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9568).

### JS backend: Template Haskell

Luite and Sylvain started implementing support for Template Haskell (TH) with
the JS backend.

Sylvain reimplemented support for running an adapted version of the
THRunner.js script from GHCJS. He also refactored the JS linker and
implemented incremental linking.

The next step is to link and to run an instance of the external interpreter code
that implements the Template Haskell protocol (execution of the `Q` monad)
adapted to run in JavaScript. GHCJS used to have its own duplicated code for
this but for maintenance concerns it’s much better to reuse the external
interpreter code.

## GHCi

### GHCi: sized primitive types (Word8#, etc.)

Luite implemented support for sized primitive types in GHCi. Cf
[!8822](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/8822).

### GHCi: “prim” calling convention

Luite implemented support for the “prim” calling convention in GHCi. Cf
[!9026](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9026)

## Compiler performance

### Jeff

Each of these improves allocations between 0.2 - 0.7% depending on the input
(improvements by a thousand cuts):

- **GHC.Foreign improved Strictness**: An Attempt to remove lazy IO and SAT an
  argument that is only used for a debug message. Got a review from Andreas.
  Want to try to 2 more improvements then ready to merge.
  [!9644](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9644)

- **InfoTableProv: ShortText → ShortByteString**: Post review from Ben I made some
  improvements that preserved type safety and still recovered most of the
  performance improvements. Ready to merge
  [!9637](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9637)

- **GHC.Unit.State**: swapped use of Data.Map for GHC.Unique.UniqMap and expanded
  UniqMap API. Results in progress (need to patch Haddock) and still
  experimental. The idea here is to use a data structure that no longer needs to
  balance on insertions because Unit.State performs a lot of merges on these
  maps.

- **GHC.Utils.Binary.foldGet’ removed lazy IO and lazy accumulator**: merged
  [!9538](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9538)

### Josh

- **Stricter break**: we noticed in a ticky profile that `GHC.List.break` allocates
  3 thunks and 1 datacon per list element returned the first part of the list.
  If this list is fully evaluated later, we can allocate only 1 datacon per list
  element instead. Preliminary results bootstrapping GHC with this change look
  very promising.

- **FastMutInt (Binary)**: Josh started reviving Sylvain’s MR
  [!7246](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/7246) about
  bundling more than one `Int#` in a `FastMutInt` for performance. He tried to
  make a proof of concept generalisation of 2-FastMutInt into n-FastMutInts
  (using GHC type level Natural). The types don’t really recurse in a convenient
  way (Int -> (… -> IO ())) so it would probably introduce more complexity than
  the problem is worth. Now, he’s just implementing the original patch with the
  fixes and documentation.
