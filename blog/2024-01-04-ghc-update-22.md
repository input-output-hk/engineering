Triweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

<!-- truncate -->

Previous updates can be found [here](https://engineering.iog.io/tags/ghc-update).

## High level summary

This sprint the team prepared a survey (internal to IOG) to find the most
pressing issues with the Haskell toolchain and what we could improve. Responses
are still incoming and will analyzed during the next sprint.

Performance of the Haskell toolchain is a common complaint, even before this
survey. The team is working on tracking GHC performance across releases and
the team made progresses on a report about this topic.

Finally the team worked on loose ends of the JS backend that would be
nice to have in the upcoming GHC 9.10: code optimizer, support for linking with
C sources (e.g. `sqlite` works), tracking code size in CI.

## Details
