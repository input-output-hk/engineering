## JavaScript backend

### Template Haskell

Sylvain: [!9779](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9779)
adding TH support for the JS backend passes CI and is ready for reviews.

Ticket [#23013](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23013) has been
opened to keep track of an issue with the recompilation avoidance mechanism.
Fixing the issue seems to require some invasive refactoring that is best left
for a future merge request.

Luite: [!10008](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10008)
Implemented keeping track of subdirectories in GHC's temporary file manager.
Ready for review. Fixes
[#22952](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22952).

Temporary subdirectories are used when linking Template Haskell with the
JavaScript backend and also in some situations when linking with other backends.
This would always result in files being left behind in GHC's temporary directory
(and a warning at high enough verbosity settings) since these subdirectories
were never removed. With this patch, GHC keeps track of all created subdirectories
and removes them at the end of the session.

### JavaScript RTS refactor

Josh: has merged the refactor of the RTS generation module to reduce redundant code.
In this refactor, debug logging was also completed to determine the correct numbers
to use as the cache sizes for generated JavaScript names - allowing us to vastly
reduce the size of these arrays for efficiency, and to remove `panic` cases in favour
of generating higher numbered names without caching.

### Integer performance

Sylvain: [!9825](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9825) has
been updated after an helpful review by Matthew Claven.

### JavaScript EDSL

Jeff: MR is [open](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10000).
In response to feedback from the team Jeff has added (and removed)
several features that distinguish the eDSL from
[sunroof](https://github.com/ku-fpg/sunroof-compiler). These include: removing
threading and continuations, adding named unique variables and a proper switch
statement. These changes allow more of the RTS to be replaced in the eDSL and
allow the RTS to be typed using Haskell's type system. For example, now the STG
registers track the type of the values they hold.

### CI

Sylvain: fixed CI script test that prevented performance results to be stored for
the JS backend (see [#22923](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22923) and
[!10026](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/10026)).

## Compiler performance

### More-strict `break`/`span`

Josh: opened a CLC (Core Libraries Committee) proposal to add stricter versions of
`break` and `span` to `Data.List` in addition to the existing lazy versions. The
proposal considers evidence that these versions are situationally more performant,
by comparing allocation statistics, generated STG, and microbenchmarks - as well as
making the argument for consistency with existing `List` functions that also have
strict versions.

- [GHC MR 9868](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9868)

### Unboxed CodeBuffers

Josh: opened a CLC proposal to modify the implementation of `CodeBuffer`s in `base`
to use unboxed tuples in the return type of encoding functions. This change presents
a significant allocation improvement, due to the difficulty GHC has with applying a
certain optimisation within data types.

- [GHC MR 9948](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9948).

### Optimization Handbook

Jeff: Has been hard at work on the [Optimization Handbook](https://input-output-hk.github.io/hs-opt-handbook.github.io/).
He has finished a
chapter on `Lambda Lifting`, significantly expanded the glossary, and added
documentation to the
[sphinx-exec-directive](https://github.com/yongrenjie/sphinx-exec-directive)
haskell extension that he finished last month. The optimization handbook is now
in review by IOG's IT team to migrate it to the Haskell Foundation website.

## GHCi

Luite: Added a testcase and did some cleanups in the types of the C code in MR
[!9957](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9957), and adjusted
the bytecode generator to not produce zero offset `SLIDE` instructions anymore.
This is now ready for review.
