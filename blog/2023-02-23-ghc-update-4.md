Biweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

## JavaScript backend

### Template Haskell

Sylvain: [!9779](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9779)
adding TH support for the JS backend passes CI and is ready for reviews.

Ticket [#23013](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23013) has been
opened to keep track of an issue with the recompilation avoidance mechanism.
Fixing the issue seems to require some invasive refactoring that is best left
for a future merge request.

[sunroof](https://github.com/ku-fpg/sunroof-compiler) close to MR, see
[#22736](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22736) for background.
Compiler is complete. Major items left are: the interpreter to translate to
`JStat`, filling in documentation, and testing now that CI has been merged.
