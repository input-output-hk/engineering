## High-level Summary


## Details

### Performance

Sylvain: improved performance of codes using user event tracing (e.g.
`traceEvent`) when tracing is disabled, putting an end to a long saga of merge
requests by different people
([GHC!3323](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/3323),
[GHC!5316](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/5316),
[GHC!12302](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12302)). I
mostly did the menial work of making the latest MR pass CI and of getting it
approved by the CLC because it impacts `base`
([CLC!291](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/291#issuecomment-2420734806)).
See [GHC!13295](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13295) and
[GHC#17949](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/17949).
