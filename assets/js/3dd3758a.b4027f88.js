There\nare two intractable reasons for the placeholder patterns. First, we require\nthese patterns to work around the limitations of JavaScript as a backend (1).\nFor example, consider the case where we need to return an ",(0,r.yg)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Int64#")," from an\nimported foreign function. In C and Haskell this is not a problem because both\ncan represent ",(0,r.yg)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Int64#")," natively, however JavaScript only has native support for\n32-bit values. Thus, to be able to return an ",(0,r.yg)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Int64#")," we need to have a method to\nreturn two 32-bit numbers. Similarly, in order to apply a function to an ",(0,r.yg)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Int64#"),"\nthat function must take at least two arguments, one for the high bits and one\nfor the low. Second, the referrent string is untyped and can contain arbritrary\nJavaScript code. So placeholder patterns provide a simply and lightweight way\nfor safety checks and eliminate classes of untyped, hard to understand errors.\nFor example, consider an arity mismatch error between a function definition and\ncall site. When this happens JavaScript happily continues processing with the\nreturn value from the function application defined as ",(0,r.yg)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"NaN")," (of course). Such\narity conflicts can easily occur, especially when dealing with 64-bit values\nwhich require function arity assumptions."),(0,r.yg)("a",{id:"org461ca2a"}),(0,r.yg)("h1",{id:"lightweight-safety-checks"},"Lightweight safety checks"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"Lightweight safety checks (3) are done by GHCJS by parsing the names of the\nplace holder variables; each of which follows a specific naming convention.
